# RUBY VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS ARENâ€™T OBJECTS, BUT ARE REFERENCES TO OBJECTS.
# Assignment merely changes which object is bound to a particular variable.

# RUBY IS PASS BY REFERENCE VALUE, pass by reference of the value, or pass by value of the reference.
# Itâ€™s a little muddy, but the 3 terms mean the same thing: RUBY PASSES AROUND COPIES OF THE REFERENCES.
# In short, ruby is neither pass by value nor pass by reference,
# but instead employs a third strategy that blends the two strategies.

# The method can use the references to modify the referenced object (if mutable),
# but since the reference itself is a copy, the original reference cannot be changed.
