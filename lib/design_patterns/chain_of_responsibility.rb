# It's pretty similar to the decorator pattern, but while the decorator pattern
# is a structural pattern, the COR is a behavioral pattern. Structural design
# patterns generally deal with the structure of the entities and the relationships
# between them, making it easier for these entities to work together. Behavioral
# design patterns focus on communication. How do we let the interested parties
# know any changes to the object. Sort of publisher to subscriber. Does not care
# about the data structure, but forces on implementing methods, i.e. channels of
# communications. The key difference is that a decorator adds new behavior, while
# COR pattern can modify an existing behavior. Decorator is used when you want to
# add functionality to an object. COR is used when one of many actors might take
# action on an object.

# GoF definition:
# Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one
# object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the
# request along the chain until an object handles it.

# The object that made the request has no explicit knowledgeof who will handle
# itâ€”we say the request has an implicit receiver.
