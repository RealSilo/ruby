# GOF definition

# Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
# Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier
# to use.

# FACADE PATTERN

# Structuring a system into subsystems helps reduce complexity. A common design
# goal is to minimize the communication and dependencies between subsystems. One
# way to achieve this goal is to introduce a facade object that provides a
# single, simplified interface to the more general facilities of a subsystem.

# Use the Facade pattern when
# - you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem
# - there are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes of
#   an abstraction. Introduce a facade to decouple the subsystem from clients and
#   other subsystems, thereby promoting subsystem independence and portability

# The Dashboard class provides a common interface for locating the userâ€™s
# collaborator objects to display the user's notifications and posts on the
# dashboard.
