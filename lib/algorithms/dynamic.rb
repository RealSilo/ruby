# PROBLEM 1: The knapsack problem:
# You wanna take a few item (value, weight) You can carry 4lbs.
# What items should you put ing the bag o maximize the value?

# Stereo $3000 3lbs
# Laptop $2000 2lbs
# Guitar $1500 1lbs
# Your limit is 4lbs -> Correct solution guitar + laptop = $3500

# This also could be solved with a greedy solution which doesn't give
# you the right answer but it's pretty close to it. Greedy solution would
# be to take the most expensive item that fits your bag then take the next
# most expensive one...
